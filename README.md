# ZETANET is the Internet 2.0

> A protocol to retire the aged TCP/IP to suite today's internet demand.

# Overview

Zetanet is a new internet protocol to replace the old TCP/IP, Addressed contents hashed name, owners signiture keys and privacy settings. Zetanet enables people to create and fully deploy application or file without relying to a centralized server or to big companies to host their application. 

Zetanet aims to replace the TCP/IP protocol to be able to significantly improve the way IP traffic is handled also for better security and smarter routing and packet forwarding, this mean the ability to move large chunks of data without necessarily identifying the address but simply pointing toward a certain topic, which would speed up information flow.

Zetanet also aims to remove the dependency of humanities data to be controled and owned by certain big companies, it's rather to give back to people the control over their data where they will be the one or the community in the network is to decide if a certain data has to be taken down. 

Zetanet aims to provide ultimate security over people's data where they would be the only one to access a data based on their own signiture, A user would be able to allow a certain data to be access by other user's by accepting the other user's key as one of the authorized signiture or by making a data publicly available singed by their own key.  

Zetanet will have it's own complimentary OS where the people who uses the OS will have be able to directly save and retrieve their files from the Zetanet, this os will also be a blockchain hub where all different blockchain's and protocol could be integrated in the OS and users will be able to select which network they would like to keep and secure their files, this means you could use any other blockchain you want and that your data will be available on earth no matter where you are, what device you use or when you need it (as long as you have your private key). for all other features of [ZetaOS.](https://zetanet.io)

# Quick Summary

Zetanet is a protocol:

- changes the way of a data is being access by letting a data to have it's own hashed name based on the Users private key, instead of relying to a single server and IP addrress to fill the thousands to millions of information requests that people and applications made.

- content delivery and routing is based on fibonacci series giving more efficient and faster response of a data in request. it also removes the need of having a centralized server to handle the routing and content delivery addressing.

Zetanet is a filesystem:
- has directories and files but can only be access by the the owner of the files based on their own private key signiture, unless a certain file/folder is set to public or set to grant access on other user with specified public key signiture
- is going to act as the local storage of the users using ZetaOS

Zetanet is modular:
- routing layer
- uses a routing layer based on Zeta series (Fibonacci series)
- connection layer over any network protocol

Zetanet uses crypto enhanced by Jack's Law:
- cryptographic-hash with mathematical equation called the Jack's law for content addressing and distribution
- file integrity and security with the encryption and users private key as signitures for their files
- filesystem-level encryption
